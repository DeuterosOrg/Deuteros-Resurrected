# Native new-game playthrough — 2026-10-03

**PASS for the bounded early-game route below**, using the Mac source build at runtime `89d39ffb164ac1c6cffe21f2cfff18610e193bbe` (documentation checkpoint `982c118`). This was physical mouse/keyboard interaction from New Game, with ordinary fast-forward; no cheats, progression presets, edited saves or injected game state.

## Route exercised

1. Train 70 researchers, 70 production staff and 10 marines in two batches. Confirm the shared recruit population decreases by 150 to 5,850. Later staff losses occur naturally through attrition.
2. Research the shuttle chassis, drive and MeH fuel. Manufacture a Derrick, chassis and drive. Confirm Stores follows the selected manufacturing recipe.
3. Build a shuttle, assign its pilot, fit the manufactured drive and rename it **FIRST LIGHT**. Escape opens Settings and pauses time; closing it resumes time.
4. Save to a previously empty test slot at `3100 926.00`, with fuel research at 45%. Reload and verify the name, engine, crew and research progress. Load opens Master Control; the Earth globe returns to the starting city.
5. Complete fuel research and let normal refining produce stock. Forty fuel-button clicks transfer exactly 40T: Earth stock 336→296, tank 0→40.
6. Take off from Earth and reach orbit with 35T. Land with 33T. Observe the interior status, engine status and available menus change through the flight.
7. Save at `3101 311.01`, reload and verify the grounded ship, name, crew of nine and 33T. Close the game normally: exit 0, strict runtime log clean.

## Evidence and limits

Screenshots, both unmodified normal-play saves, logs and results are preserved locally under `artifacts/validation/evidence/early-game-desktop-89d39ff/`. The final checkpoint is `final-slot-4.json`; its backup preserves the earlier save. These ignored artifacts do not travel with Git. All pre-existing user save files and hashes were restored exactly after testing; the pre-existing Godot editor remained open.

The playthrough exposed overlapping Research mass units, addressed by the later case-591 follow-up. It also prompted a separate low-population training regression; that boundary was staged in case 590, not reached in this campaign.

This establishes early progression and a first shuttle roundtrip on Mac. It does not establish a complete campaign, native Windows behavior, original-runtime timing or subjective audio quality. Continue from the preserved normal checkpoint toward orbital construction before claiming later progression.
